## üß† AI Integration Strategy

### Code Generation & Scaffolding

#### IDE Integration (Cursor/VS Code)
- **Feature Scaffolding**: Use AI to generate boilerplate code for new features
  ```
  Prompt: "Generate a FastAPI route for user profile management with SQLAlchemy, including GET, PUT, and DELETE endpoints with proper error handling and validation"
  ```
- **Component Generation**: Create reusable UI components with consistent patterns
  ```
  Prompt: "Create a responsive PostCard component with JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and proper accessibility attributes"
  ```
- **Database Schema**: Generate SQLAlchemy models and Alembic migrations
  ```
  Prompt: "Design a database schema for a blogging platform with users, posts, comments, tags, and categories, including all necessary relationships and indexes"
  ```

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Testing with AI
